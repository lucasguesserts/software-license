# Free and Open Source Software

Free Software != Open Source Software

## Free Software

(Adapted from [GNU](https://www.gnu.org/)).

Free software means that the software's users have freedom. Specifically, free software means users have the [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html):

0. to run the program;
1. to study and change the program in source code form;
2. to redistribute exact copies;
3. to distribute modified versions;

Check out [licenses approved by the Free Software Foundation here](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/license-list.html).

## Open Source Software

(Adapted from [The Open Source Definition](https://opensource.org/osd/)).

To be considered "Open Source", a Software must comply with 10 criterias:

1. Free Redistribution;
2. Source Code: The program must include source code;
3. Derived Works;
4. Integrity of The Authorâ€™s Source Code;
5. No Discrimination Against Persons or Groups;
6. No Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor;
7. Distribution of License;
8. License Must Not Be Specific to a Product;
9. License Must Not Restrict Other Software;
10. License Must Be Technology-Neutral;

## Differences between Free Software and Open Source Software

Although they have many similarities, they are distinct concepts. Free Software is about freedom, while Open Source Software is about the practical benefits of having the source code open.

People tend to use the term "[FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software)" (Free and Open Source Software) or "[FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_terms_for_free_software#FLOSS)" (free/libre and open-source software) to refer to a mid-term between the two, even though some may say that it is not appropriate to do so.

See the references for further discussion on the topic. Check out also the [section Approvals of the Wikipedia page on Comparison of free and open-source software licenses](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses#Approvals).
